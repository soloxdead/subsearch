# subsearch
Subsearch is a bash script to perform a quick recon. It uses https://crt.sh to find subdomains based on the websites certs and saving them into a results.txt text file. After completion, it will offer to perform a quick scan to check ports 80 and 443 to see if the domain(s) are currently running. This program is very beta.
